Xonotic Licensing
=================


Scope
-----

This licensing document pertains to:

- Official Xonotic releases

- The Team Xonotic-owned branches (i.e. those whose name does not contain a
  slash, like "master" and "div0-stable") of the repositories on
  git://git.xonotic.org/xonotic/ including all their ancestor commits

Team Xonotic does not make any guarantees for licensing or legal status of any
content not as part of official Xonotic releases or Team Xonotic-owned
branches, such as:

- Files downloaded from a web server by Xonotic (e.g. automatic map downloads)

- Branches of our repository that are owned by a user of the repository, and
  thus not owned by Team Xonotic (these branches are always prefixed with user
  name and a slash, as in "divVerent/")

For status of such content, please contact its author.
