## Contributing

We're currently looking for help in the following areas:

- Modeling and texturing
  - We're looking for someone with texturing skills to paint new glowy skins for our player models
- Documentation
  - Some of it is still scattered in [Docs](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/tree/master/Docs) instead of being on our [wiki](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/home)
  - Some [wiki](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/wikis/home) pages are slightly out of date or contain links to empty pages
  - Fixing typos everywhere and anywhere - attention to detail is important to make a good impression on potential players
  - Even if you're new, just letting us know what you're struggling with helps so we can focus on improving those areas first
- Testing
  - If you're running a server or play off-line often, please consider using the autobuild or git versions to help us find bugs
